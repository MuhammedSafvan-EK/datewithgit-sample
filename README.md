Git & GitHub Practice Repository

This repository is created as part of my hands-on learning and practice with Git and GitHub. The main goal is to understand and apply core version control concepts like commits, branches, pushing code, handling merge conflicts, pull requests, and GitHub repository management.

Initializing Git repositories (git init)

Staging and committing changes (git add, git commit)

Connecting to remote repositories (git remote add origin)

Pushing code to GitHub (git push)

Pulling updates (git pull)

Branching and merging (git branch, git checkout, git merge)

Resolving merge conflicts

Creating and reviewing pull requests

Cloning repositories

Working with .gitignore files

Writing commit messages

GitHub repository setup and README creation

ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This repo helps me:

Get comfortable with version control commands

Understand how Git tracks project history

Collaborate on projects through GitHub workflows

Prepare for real-world development projects

ðŸš€ Future Plans

I will continue adding more scenarios, such as:

Rebasing and cherry-picking

Using Git hooks

Tagging releases

CI/CD with GitHub Actions

ðŸ“š Resources

Git Official Documentation

GitHub Docs
